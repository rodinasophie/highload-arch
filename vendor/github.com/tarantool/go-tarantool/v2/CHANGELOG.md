## [Unreleased]

- Enumeration types for RLimitAction/iterators (#158)
- IsNullable flag for Field (#302)
- More linters on CI (#310)
- Meaningful description for read/write socket errors (#129)
- Support password and password file to decrypt private SSL key file (#319)
- Support `operation_data` in `crud.Error` (#330) 
- Support `fetch_latest_metadata` option for crud requests with metadata (#335)
- Support `noreturn` option for data change crud requests (#335)
- Support `crud.schema` request (#336, #351)
- Support `IPROTO_WATCH_ONCE` request type for Tarantool 
  version >= 3.0.0-alpha1 (#337)
- Support `yield_every` option for crud select requests (#350)
- Support `IPROTO_FEATURE_SPACE_AND_INDEX_NAMES` for Tarantool
  version >= 3.0.0-alpha1 (#338). It allows to use space and index names 
  in requests instead of their IDs.
- `GetSchema` function to get the actual schema (#7)
- Support connection via an existing socket fd (#321)

### Changed

- connection_pool renamed to pool (#239)
- Use msgpack/v5 instead of msgpack.v2 (#236)
- Call/NewCallRequest = Call17/NewCall17Request (#235)
- Change encoding of the queue.Identify() UUID argument from binary blob to
  plain string. Needed for upgrade to Tarantool 3.0, where a binary blob is
  decoded to a varbinary object (#313).
- Use objects of the Decimal type instead of pointers (#238)
- Use objects of the Datetime type instead of pointers (#238)
- `connection.Connect` no longer return non-working 
  connection objects (#136). This function now does not attempt to reconnect 
  and tries to establish a connection only once. Function might be canceled 
  via context. Context accepted as first argument.
  `pool.Connect` and `pool.Add` now accept context as first argument, which 
  user may cancel in process. If `pool.Connect` is canceled in progress, an 
  error will be returned. All created connections will be closed.
- `iproto.Feature` type now used instead of `ProtocolFeature` (#337)
- `iproto.IPROTO_FEATURE_` constants now used instead of local `Feature` 
  constants for `protocol` (#337)
- Change `crud` operations `Timeout` option type to `crud.OptFloat64`
  instead of `crud.OptUint` (#342)
- Change all `Upsert` and `Update` requests to accept `*tarantool.Operations` 
  as `ops` parameters instead of `interface{}` (#348)
- Change `OverrideSchema(*Schema)` to `SetSchema(Schema)` (#7)
- Change values, stored by pointers in the `Schema`, `Space`, `Index` structs, 
  to be stored by their values (#7)
- Make `Dialer` mandatory for creation a single connection / connection pool (#321)
- Remove `Connection.RemoteAddr()`, `Connection.LocalAddr()`.
  Add `Addr()` function instead (#321)
- Remove `Connection.ClientProtocolInfo`, `Connection.ServerProtocolInfo`.
  Add `ProtocolInfo()` function, which returns the server protocol info (#321)
- `NewWatcher` checks the actual features of the server, rather than relying
  on the features provided by the user during connection creation (#321)
- `pool.NewWatcher` does not create watchers for connections that do not support
  it (#321)
- Rename `pool.GetPoolInfo` to `pool.GetInfo`. Change return type to
  `map[string]ConnectionInfo` (#321)

### Deprecated

- All Connection.<Request>, Connection.<Request>Typed and
  Connection.<Request>Async methods. Instead you should use requests objects +
  Connection.Do() (#241)
- All ConnectionPool.<Request>, ConnectionPool.<Request>Typed and
  ConnectionPool.<Request>Async methods. Instead you should use requests
  objects + ConnectionPool.Do() (#241)
- box.session.push() usage: Future.AppendPush() and Future.GetIterator()
  methods, ResponseIterator and TimeoutResponseIterator types (#324)
